Menpha
======

I'm not good at Licenses. Use this though:

You may use any part or all of the code to work on something unique from the idea of Menpha. You are free to use them. Attributing menpha as the inspiration for what you'll do isn't mandatory. Doing so actually doesn't put money in my pocket, unless you explicitly want that to happen. I'll be much appreciative then.

If you wish to use my code to create something same as the idea of Menpha, then I'll recommend you contribute code to this repository and help improve. If you have better idea of making this idea a success and wish to see the furtherance of it, kindly discuss with me at seanmavley [-at-] gmail [-dot-] com

Thank you.
